# Thought Experiment, on yesNoThinking
I really dont know i would love some peer review of my code, its about decision making

its a thought experement really. i hope its easy to understand. 

the Source Code can be found in LogicalThinking.java

"Given a discussion between two people, say one is a flat earther with a belief that to make the number two, with two numbers, you can use 2+1.

Someone (me) is trying to convince that person that it's 1+1, not 3. my decision at the end is to be intellectually dishonest with myself, to cease the argument. Earth being round vs. being flat is one fixed thought that is trying to be shown with explicit variables of one logical and illogical value.

The following isn't meant to be useful without having the source code to play with."

I'm trying to ask see how human thinking works with a logical person, and illogical person, and what happens when a person lies to themselves to stop an agreement between the two. It's a rough way to explain it. As I'm always getting into arguments with people about evolution and the such, I wanted to see the logical thought pattern involved.

"the proposed question" is what the two people are being asked in the CODE. hardwired beliefs as, are in real life. it is a proposed thought experiment, based on a real life interaction between two people, who both have a deep seeded truth. one of these people changes their mind to agree. 

Can you please tell me how bad it is, or how good it is? the code is complete and works EXACTLY as i want it too, just want to know for example, if i used boolean values correctly.
