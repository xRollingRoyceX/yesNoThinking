# Thought Experiment, on yesNoThinking
I would love some peer review of my code, its a thought experement really. I hope its easy to understand; before you start reading, some find this code weird.The Source Code can be found in LogicalThinking.java

The following isn't meant to be useful without having the source code to play with:

Given a discussion between two people, say one is a flat earther with a belief that to make the number two, with two numbers, you can use this set of integers and operation: 2+1. Someone (me) is trying to convince that person that it's 1+1, not 1+2. my decision at the end is to be intellectually dishonest with myself, to cease the argument. 

"the proposed question," is what the two people are being asked in the CODE, the hardwired beliefs, are as in real life. Based on a real life interaction between two people, who both, have a deep seeded truth. One of these people (me) make a conscience effort to makes changes to their mind to agree against my facts. 

lastly for a real life example i give you this: Earth being round vs. being flat is one fixed thought pattern, that im trying to show with explicit variables of one fixed logical, and illogical value. I personally believe that this is good enough real life example to give the code code some color, without offending a large portion of people. I'm trying to ask see how human thinking works with a logical person, and illogical person, and what happens when a person lies to themselves to stop an agreement between the two. 

The thought experiment is up to you, but a peer review would be nice.
