Given a discussion between two people. Lets, say one is a flat eather, Person_IL, with a belief that, to solve for the number two, with two numbers, you have to use the set of numbers /w with the following expression [2]+[1]. Someone else, Person_L, is trying to convince Person_IL that its [1]+[1], not [2]+[1]. The decision at the end is for Person_L to be intellectually dishonest with themselves, and cease this ongoing argument. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

 

-Earth being round vs. being flat is just one of many fixed thoughts that is being shown here. 

-The variables are of one logical(L) value, and one illogical(IL) value. 

-The proposed question challenges the hardwired beliefs that are held by both people, both people have a deep seeded truth they both believe in equally.  

-One of these people must make the conscience effort to change their mind.(intellectually dishonest with themselves)

[why am I using 2+1 for (IL)? This is because, in this argument, Person_L's argument is entirely based off a simple, logical fact, that is indisputable. So for Person_IL to say that the earth is flat, is equivalent to them saying,--> [2]+[1]=|2| NOT [2]+[1]=|3|]
while argument is based on something that can be proven;
IF (L = FACT)
   IL must be wrong
      IF (IL == belief)
          L must be right. 
              IF (L != IL)
                  -infinity-
