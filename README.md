Logical thinking in java by:

this is a story. written with one foot in code, and the other in life.
 

 

Given a discussion between two people. Les, say one is a flat eather, Person_IL, with a belief that to make the number two, with two numbers, you have to use 2+1. Someone else, Person_L, is trying to convince Person_IL that its 1+1, not 2+1. The decision at the end is for Person_L to be intellectually dishonest with themselves, and ceas this ongoing argument.

Earth being round vs. being flat is just one of many fixed thoughts that is being shown here. 

The variables of one logical(L) value and one illogical(IL) value. 

The proposed question challenges the hardwired beliefs that are held by both people. As both people have a deep seeded truth they both believe in equally.  

One of these people must make the conscience effort to change their mind.(intellectually dishonest with themselves) 

[why am I using 2+1 for (IL)? This is because, in this argument, Person_L's argument is entirely based off a simple, logical fact, that is indisputable. So for Person_IL to say that the earth is flat, is equivalent to them saying, (2+1 = 2) NOT (2+1=3) ]
